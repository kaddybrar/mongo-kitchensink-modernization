## [Unreleased] - Performance Testing Implementation

### Summary of Changes (2024-03-XX)

#### Motivation
The project needed a robust performance testing framework to:
1. Compare MongoDB and PostgreSQL performance characteristics during migration
2. Ensure application performance remains stable during database migration
3. Measure and optimize frontend user experience
4. Provide data-driven insights for the migration strategy

#### Key Implementations

1. **Database Strategy Performance Testing**
   - Implemented comparison tests between JPA, MongoDB, and dual-write strategies
   - Added warmup phase (10 iterations) to ensure stable measurements
   - Included 100 test iterations for statistical significance
   - Measures:
     * CRUD operation latencies
     * Concurrent request handling
     * Data consistency in dual-write mode
   
2. **Application Startup Performance**
   - Added dedicated startup time measurements
   - Tests different database configurations
   - Measures impact of dual-write mode on startup
   - Helps optimize application initialization

3. **Frontend Performance Monitoring**
   - Implemented Core Web Vitals tracking
   - Added real-user-like testing with Puppeteer
   - Measures impact of database operations on UI responsiveness
   - Provides insights into user experience metrics

4. **Containerized Test Environment**
   - Created isolated test environments for reproducibility
   - Added health checks for dependencies
   - Implemented volume mounts for persistent test results
   - Ensures consistent test execution across environments

5. **Automated Reporting System**
   - Added HTML report generation with interactive charts
   - Implemented comparative analysis between test runs
   - Created timestamped test results for tracking trends
   - Provides clear visualization of performance metrics

#### Benefits
1. **Data-Driven Migration**
   - Quantifiable performance metrics for each database strategy
   - Clear visibility into performance trade-offs
   - Evidence-based decision making for migration timing

2. **Quality Assurance**
   - Automated performance regression detection
   - Consistent test environments
   - Reproducible test results
   - Early warning system for performance issues

3. **Development Efficiency**
   - Easy-to-run test suite
   - Clear performance reports
   - Local and CI/CD support
   - Minimal setup requirements

4. **User Experience**
   - Proactive performance monitoring
   - Frontend performance optimization
   - End-to-end latency tracking
   - Real-world usage simulation
