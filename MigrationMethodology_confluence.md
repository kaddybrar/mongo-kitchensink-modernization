Overview

This documentation talks about the KitchenSink Application Migration plan, the reason why we are doing it and steps we took to complete the migration
Motivation

Currently, we are going through a migration phase, in which we are analysing the existing services and if there is need for migrating them to better tech stack.
Migration Plan 

Under the migration plan, we will be dividing our whole implementation in 4 phases :

    Phase 1 : understanding the current application, business usecases it covers and issues it might be facing

    Phase 2 : Formulating the migration plan based on business usecase, domain model and issues the service is facing and plan out the iteration of development

    Phase 3 : Migrating the Backend Service and integrating the APIs with existing FE.

    Phase 4 : Migrating the Frontend Service and integrating it with new Backend

    Phase 5 : Further improvements on deployment strategy, containerization, integration with Mongo, backward compatibility to iterations and performance testing

 
Phase 1 : Understanding the current state
Setting up the existing service locally

    Git clone the repo .

    install redhat EJB.

    Mvn clean and install 

    Run the hello world(documentation improvement to make the first run from project root instead of quickstart root)

    Run the kitchenSink

    Took help from cursor to configure the project and resolve issues while running the project from root, for example adding the dependency for JMS or running the EJB server using standalone-all.

KitchenSink - Existing service

KitchenSink service is a Member CRUD service and is also exposing a UI to interact with member entity. 
TechStack

UI Layer (JSF) → REST Layer (JAX-RS) → Service Layer (EJB) → Data Layer (JPA)

Core functionalities

Core functionalities supported by kitchen sink service are :

    Register new members

    List all members

    Form validation

    Database persistence

    RESTful endpoints

Entities(Domain)

The Member entity is defined with the following fields and constraints:
TABLE Member (
    id BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    phone_number VARCHAR(12) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id),
    CONSTRAINT UK_email UNIQUE (email),
    CONSTRAINT CHK_name CHECK (name NOT REGEXP '[0-9]'),
    CONSTRAINT CHK_phone CHECK (phone_number REGEXP '^[0-9]{10,12}$')
);

The entity is mapped to a database table with a unique constraint on the email column. It's also exposed as a RESTful service and can be serialized to XML (via @XmlRootElement).

Phase 3 : Backend Migration

In Backend migration, we would be migrating the current kitchensink application to Springboot + postgres techstack :
Migrating the service to Springboot

We will be migrating the service to latest version of springboot.

Here we can directly utilize AI to 

    create a base project with springboot dependencies

    update the pom.xml based on existing application. for example adding starter dependencies to expose REST Apis

Migrating API, Service and Dao Layer

In this stage, we will be migrating :
Controller Layer

In this stage, we will be migrating the Controller to expose the REST APIs for Member CRUD.

Base URL: /api/v1/members

The APIs would be :
1. Get All Members

Method: GET

Endpoint: /

Description: Retrieves all members

Response: 200 OK
  [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "name": "string",

          }

        404 Not Found: Member not found

        400 Bad Request: Invalid ID format (for JPA mode)

4. Update Member

Method: PUT

Description: Updates an existing member

Path Parameters: id (string)

Request Body:
  {
    "name": "string",
    "email": "string",
    "phoneNumber": "string"

      }

    Responses:

        200 OK: Member updated successfully

        400 Bad Request: Invalid input

        404 Not Found: Member not found

        409 Conflict: Email already exists

5. Delete Member

    Method: DELETE

    Endpoint: /{id}

    Description: Deletes a member

    Path Parameters: id (string)

    Responses:

        204 No Content: Member deleted successfully

        404 Not Found: Member not found

6. Search Members

Method: GET

Endpoint: /search

Description: Searches for members by name

Query Parameters: name (string)

Response: 200 OK
  [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "name": "string",
      "email": "string",
      "phoneNumber": "string"
    }

      ]

Validation Rules

    Name:

        Required

        Non-blank

    Email:

        Required

        Must be a valid email format

        Must be unique in the system

    Phone Number:

        Optional

        Must match pattern: ^\\+?[0-9]{10,15}$

        Example: "+12345678901"

Service Layer

In this stage, we will be migrating the Service layer of application to integrate with controller and the future DAO layer interacting with DB.
MemberService

Member Service exposes these business logics in it.

    Create Member

        Validates email uniqueness

        Creates new member record

        Returns created member

        Throws DuplicateEmailException if email exists

    Get All Members

        Retrieves all members from database

        Returns list of members

        Supports pagination (through repository)

    Get Member by ID

        Retrieves specific member by ID

        Handles ID type conversion (Long for JPA, String for MongoDB)

        Throws MemberNotFoundException if not found

    Update Member

        Validates member exists

        Checks email uniqueness if email changed

        Updates member details

        Returns updated member

        Throws exceptions for not found or duplicate email

    Delete Member

        Removes member by ID

        Returns boolean indicating success

        Handles non-existent members gracefully

    Search Members

        Searches by name (case-insensitive)

        Returns list of matching members

Dao Layer
H2 Database → Postgres database

In the DAO layer, we will be migrating from H2 database to Postgres database and the reason for doing so is because : 

    PostgreSQL is a production-grade database with full ACID compliance

    H2 is primarily meant for development and testing environments

    While H2 would be suitable for unit tests and development, PostgreSQL better serves this project's goals of demonstrating real-world database migration and performance measurement.

Further advantages of using postgres are :

    Full-text search

    JSON data types

    Complex indexing

    Better concurrency handling

Indexes on Name and Email

We would also be having indexes on Name and Email to help with search functionality in our database
MemberJPARepository Class

The JpaMemberRepository is a Spring Data JPA repository interface that manages the persistence of member entities in a relational database. Here are its key functionalities:

     Core Repository Operations

    Custom Query Methods

    Entity Management

    Transaction Support

    Validation Support

API documentation

Further we have integrated the service with Swagger.

Swagger (now known as OpenAPI) is a powerful tool for documenting and testing REST APIs. It provides:

    API Documentation: Automatically generates interactive documentation from code annotations or specification files.

    Visual Interface: Offers a web-based UI (Swagger UI) where developers can:

        View all API endpoints

        Test API calls directly in the browser

        See request/response formats

        Understand authentication requirements

    Code Generation: Can generate client SDKs and server stubs in various programming languages.

    Standardization: Provides a standardized way to describe REST APIs using either JSON or YAML format.

    Testing: Enables API testing and validation during development.

This makes API development, documentation, and testing more efficient and maintainable.

Swagger url : http://backend:8081/swagger-ui/index.html
Unit and Integration Testing along Coverage

Further, we have added testing for the application :

Unit Tests (Eg: JpaMemberServiceTest):

    Tests CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

    Validates email uniqueness

    Tests error handling (MemberNotFoundException, DuplicateEmailException)

    Verifies member search functionality

    Tests input validation (invalid IDs, emails, phone numbers)

Integration Tests ( Eg: JpaMemberIntegrationTest):

    Tests API endpoints through MockMvc

    Validates HTTP responses and status codes

    Tests actual database interactions

    Verifies data persistence

    Tests input validation at API level

    Ensures proper JSON serialization/deserialization

    Tests search functionality with real database queries

    Includes cleanup mechanisms via TestDataManager

All tests use proper test data isolation and mock dependencies where appropriate.

The test suite ensures:

    Business logic correctness

    Data integrity

    API contract adherence

    Proper error handling

    Input validation

    Database operations accuracy

Commit changes and its' details
Phase 4.1 : Frontend Migration - JS + HTML

In Stage 1, we will be migrating the existing JSF pages to JS and HTML pages.
Advantages of Doing so
Decoupled Architecture

    Separation of Concerns: The frontend and backend become truly independent components that can evolve separately.

    Technology Independence: The frontend is no longer tied to JSF/Jakarta EE technology stack.

    Easier Maintenance: Changes to one layer don't necessarily require changes to the other.

Modern Development Approach

    Alignment with Industry Standards: This approach follows modern web development practices using REST APIs.

    Microservices Friendly: Fits better with microservices architecture where services communicate via APIs.

    Frontend Framework Compatibility: Makes it easier to migrate to modern frontend frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue in the future.

Performance Improvements

    Reduced Server Load: Processing moves from server-side (JSF) to client-side (JavaScript).

    Faster User Experience: No full page reloads required; only data is transferred, not entire HTML.

    Asynchronous Operations: Users can continue interacting with the page while data is being fetched or submitted.

Enhanced User Experience

    Responsive Interface: Immediate feedback without page refreshes.

    Better Error Handling: More granular control over error messages and user notifications.

    Improved Interactivity: Easier to implement features like real-time validation and dynamic content updates.

Development Workflow Improvements

    Parallel Development: Frontend and backend teams can work simultaneously with clear API contracts.

    Easier Testing: Both layers can be tested independently.

    Better Debugging: Clearer separation makes it easier to identify where issues occur.

Deployment Flexibility

    Independent Deployment: Frontend and backend can be deployed separately.

    Multiple Clients: The same backend API can serve web, mobile, and other clients.

    Infrastructure Options: Frontend can be hosted on static hosting services (like S3, Netlify, etc.).

This modernization approach transforms a traditional monolithic Jakarta EE application into a more contemporary web application architecture that aligns with current industry best practices and provides a foundation for future enhancements.
Frontend Migration Implementation
Added JavaScript Functions

    loadMembers(): Fetches all members from the API

    displayMembers(): Updates the DOM with member data

    registerMember(): Sends POST request to create a new member

    deleteMember(): Sends DELETE request to remove a member

    searchMembers(): Fetches members filtered by name

    clearSearch(): Resets search and loads all members

    showMessage(): Displays feedback to the user

Replaced JSF Forms with HTML Forms

    Changed from JSF-based forms to regular HTML forms with JavaScript event handlers

    Added event.preventDefault() to stop form submission and handle via JavaScript

Added Dynamic Table Loading

    Members table is now populated dynamically via JavaScript

    Added a tbody with ID for easy DOM manipulation

Added User Feedback

    Added a message div to show success/error messages

    Messages auto-hide after 5 seconds

Improved Styling

    Added CSS for better form layout

    Styled buttons with appropriate colors

    Added spacing between elements

CORS Handling
The code assumes the backend has CORS enabled to allow requests from the frontend
Error Handling

    Added proper error handling for all API calls

    Shows user-friendly error messages

    This implementation completely decouples the frontend from JSF and directly communicates with the Spring Boot backend using fetch API. The backend will need to have CORS enabled to accept these cross-origin requests.

 
Phase 4.2 - Migrating Frontend to ReactJs + TypeScript

In this stage, we are going to migrate the application in vanilla Javascript + html to reactJs + TypeScript and below is the analysis, why we should do it :

Steps we took for implementation

Here's a brief summary of the steps taken to implement dockerization in both frontend and backend:
Frontend (React) Dockerization

Created Dockerfile:
# Build stage
FROM node:18-alpine as build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

Data Migation : Flyway
Database Migration Management

    Version control for database schemas

    Consistent database state across environments

    Support for both PostgreSQL and MongoDB migrations

    Safe database evolution during the migration process

Changes we did to integrate flyway in backend

Configuration in application.properties:
# PostgreSQL Flyway Configuration
spring.flyway.enabled=true
spring.flyway.baseline-on-migrate=true
spring.flyway.locations=classpath:db/migration/postgresql
spring.flyway.validate-on-migrate=true

# MongoDB Flyway Configuration
spring.flyway.mongodb.enabled=true
spring.flyway.mongodb.locations=classpath:db/migration/mongodb
spring.flyway.mongodb.uri=${MONGODB_URI}

Migration Scripts Structure:
db/migration/
├── postgresql/
│   ├── V1__create_member_table.sql
│   └── V2__add_indexes.sql
└── mongodb/
    ├── V1__create_collections.js
    └── V2__add_validations.js

PostgreSQL Migrations Example:
-- V1__create_member_table.sql
CREATE TABLE member (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    phone_number VARCHAR(15),
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

MongoDB Migrations Example:
// V1__create_collections.js
db.createCollection("member", {
  validator: {
    $jsonSchema: {
      required: ["name", "email"],
      properties: {
        name: { type: "string" },
        email: { type: "string" },
        phoneNumber: { type: "string" }
      }
    }
  }

    });

Phase 6 : Migration to MongoDB - Dual write Strategy Plan

The migration is done in a way that minimizes changes to existing code and preserves all documentation.

With this implementation, you can follow this migration plan:
Stage 1: Initial Setup and Validation

    Enable dual-write with JPA as the read source

    Monitor logs for discrepancies

    Fix any issues in the MongoDB implementation

Stage 2: Data Synchronization

    Run a one-time data migration script to ensure all historical data is in MongoDB

    Continue dual-write to keep new data synchronized

    Validate data consistency between systems

Stage 3: Gradual Read Migration

    Switch read source to MongoDB for non-critical operations or a subset of users

    Monitor performance and correctness

    Gradually increase MongoDB read traffic

Stage 4: Complete Migration

    Switch all reads to MongoDB

    Maintain dual-write for a safety period

    Eventually disable dual-write to JPA

    Finally, switch to direct MongoDB strategy

This approach provides a safe, gradual migration path with the ability to roll back at any point if issues arise.
MongoDB Migration Implementation

We've implemented a comprehensive strategy to migrate from PostgreSQL to MongoDB using a dual-write pattern. Here's a summary of the key changes:
1. Architecture Enhancements

    Common Interface: Created IMember interface to provide a unified contract for both database implementations

    Dual Model Support: Implemented parallel entity models for PostgreSQL (JpaMember) and MongoDB (MongoMember)

    Service Layer Abstraction: Developed IMemberService interface with specific implementations for each database type

    Factory Pattern: Added MemberFactory to create appropriate entity implementations based on configuration

2. Dual-Write Implementation

    DualWriteMemberService: Created a service that orchestrates writing to both databases while reading from a configurable source

    Transaction-like Behavior: Implemented rollback mechanisms for failed operations to maintain data consistency

    Configurable Read Source: Added ability to switch read operations between PostgreSQL and MongoDB

    Data Consistency Verification: Added optional comparison of data between databases to identify inconsistencies

3. ID Handling Strategy

    Unified ID Interface: Modified service and controller layers to use String IDs universally

    Type Conversion: Implemented transparent conversion between Long IDs (JPA) and String IDs (MongoDB)

    ID Generation: Ensured proper ID generation and synchronization between databases

4. Configuration System

    Database Type Selection: Added properties to control database mode (JPA, MongoDB, or dual)

    Read Source Configuration: Added ability to configure which database to read from during migration

    Feature Toggles: Implemented toggles for dual-write and data comparison features

5. Testing Framework

    Comprehensive Test Suite: Added tests for all components in different database modes

    Integration Tests: Created integration tests for JPA-only, MongoDB-only, and dual-write scenarios

    Test Utilities: Developed utilities for database setup, teardown, and test data generation

6. Error Handling

    Exception Handling: Enhanced exception handling to properly manage database-specific errors

    Graceful Fallback: Implemented fallback mechanisms when operations on MongoDB fail

7. Documentation

    Migration Strategy: Documented the migration approach, phases, and configuration options

    Code Documentation: Added comprehensive JavaDoc comments to explain the migration-related components

    README Updates: Updated README with information about the MongoDB migration strategy

8. Configuration Files

    Application Properties: Added MongoDB connection properties and migration configuration options

    Test Properties: Updated test configuration to support testing with different database modes

These changes provide a robust foundation for a gradual, zero-downtime migration from PostgreSQL to MongoDB, allowing for phased testing and validation with minimal risk.
